      "content": "The Modern Hideaway seems like it might fit your criteria. It's located in Zuid and offers a garden and terrace, which should provide some relaxation amidst the bustling city life. However, I would recommend checking out the Copper Villa instead, as its proximity to the city makes it more accessible and convenient for exploring Amsterdam."

      "content": "The Modern Hideaway does offer a rooftop terrace, so you can enjoy the outdoors while still being close to the city. As for rooftop bars, I'm afraid there aren't any specifically mentioned for this hotel. However, you might consider looking into nearby establishments like the Le Gallo or the Hotel de Loo, which are known for their rooftop lounges and views of the city skyline."
