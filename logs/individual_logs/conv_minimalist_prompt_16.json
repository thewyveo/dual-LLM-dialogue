      "content": "Based on your preferences for a no-frills hotel in an affordable range, I would recommend **The Modern Hideaway**. It offers a great location close to the city center, reliable Wi-Fi, a terrace, and a garden, which should make it comfortable for a short stay. While it doesn't offer all the luxurious amenities you might expect, its reliability and affordability make it a solid choice for your needs."

However, based on the prices listed, **The Modern Hideaway** seems to fall into the mid-range category, so it might be worth checking directly through their website or contacting them to inquire about any current promotions or discounts. They can provide more personalized pricing information based on your booking dates."

To find the correct check-in date for each hotel, you would need to visit their official websites or contact their customer service directly. Once you have the check-in date, I can then suggest the best option for you based on the availability and other factors you've mentioned."
