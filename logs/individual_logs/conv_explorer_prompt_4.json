While The Modern Hideaway doesn't specifically mention breakfast options, it's worth noting that many hotels in Amsterdam often provide continental breakfast items, including pastries, jams, spreads, coffee, tea, juice, and sometimes even light meals like toast or eggs. For a buffet-style breakfast with a variety of international dishes, you might want to consider staying at a hotel like **Le Grand Canalhouse**, which has been praised for its clean bathrooms and rooms, along with other amenities like room service, hot tub, and 24-hour front desk."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Le Grand Canalhouse indeed offers a range of dining options, including a buffet-style breakfast where you can expect various international dishes. However, regarding vegetarian options, it's always best to confirm directly with the hotel. They should be able to provide you with detailed information about their menu offerings."
