      "content": "Sure, let's look into the bathrooms at both hotels. For **Le Grand Canalhouse**, the internal review states: \"Bathroom cleanliness could be improved.\" This suggests that while the overall quality of the hotel is quite good, there are areas where improvements could be made, specifically concerning the cleanliness of the bathrooms. On the other hand, for **The Modern Hideaway**, the internal review mentions: \"Walls are thin, could hear neighbors at night.\" While this indicates potential noise issues, the review does not mention anything directly related to bathroom cleanliness."
