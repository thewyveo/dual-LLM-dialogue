However, since The Modern Hideaway is centrally located, it might be worth checking out the local area for other dining options that offer authentic Dutch food. Some popular spots include **De Kerk**, known for its traditional Dutch dishes, and **Het Grote Vleesbak**, offering hearty meat-based meals."
